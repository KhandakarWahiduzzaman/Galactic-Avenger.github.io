            The Nubian Ibex (<i>Capra nubiana</i>) is a wild goat species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. 
            Recognizable by its impressive, backward-curving horns and sure-footed agility, it thrives in steep, rocky terrains.

            These herbivores primarily graze on grasses and leaves, often navigating near-vertical cliffs to access vegetation. 
            Their remarkable climbing abilities help them evade predators and access food sources that are inaccessible to other animals.

        <p>
            Nubian Ibexes live in social groups, with females and young forming herds, while males are more solitary or form smaller bachelor groups. 
            Habitat loss and hunting have impacted their populations, but conservation efforts are underway to protect these majestic creatures.
