        <p>
            The Sand Cat (<i>Felis margarita</i>) is a small wild cat perfectly adapted to life in desert environments. 
            With its large ears and thick fur covering its paws, it is well-equipped to survive extreme heat and cold 
            in sandy landscapes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike domestic cats, the Sand Cat can go for long periods without drinking water, 
            getting most of its hydration from the prey it consumes, such as rodents, birds, and insects. 
            It is a nocturnal hunter, using its keen senses to locate prey underground.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to its elusive nature, the Sand Cat is rarely seen in the wild. However, habitat destruction and 
            illegal pet trade threaten its survival. Conservation efforts focus on protecting its natural habitat 
            and preventing illegal wildlife trade.
