        <!-- Animal Description -->
        <div class="info-box">
        <p>
            The Arabian Leopard (<i>Panthera pardus nimr</i>) is a rare and critically endangered subspecies 
            found in the mountainous regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It is much smaller than other leopards, 
            with a golden-yellow coat covered in black rosettes that provide excellent camouflage in rocky environments.

            This elusive predator primarily feeds on ibexes, gazelles, and hares. It is a solitary hunter, 
            using its sharp senses and agility to ambush prey. Unfortunately, habitat destruction, 
            human-wildlife conflict, and poaching have led to a drastic decline in their population.

            Conservation programs in Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are working to protect the Arabian Leopard. 
            Protected areas and breeding programs aim to increase their numbers, but their future remains uncertain. 
            Raising awareness and implementing strong conservation measures are essential for their survival.
